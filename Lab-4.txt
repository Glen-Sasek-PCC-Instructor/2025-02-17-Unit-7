Lab 04 - Algorithm and Algorithm Efficiency

There are 10 questions in this lab.  
You will make a copy of this document for your work. 
Submit your work to the Lab 04 Assignment in D2L. 
Solutions will be posted the day after the lab is due and 
only for students who submit work. 
Check your answers - learning to self-assess is super important 
and will help you become a better computer scientist!


1. What is the algorithm for swapping two items stored in cells H and Z? 
   Must write algorithms in full English sentences and steps.



2. 	Consider the following lists of partially sorted numbers using Insertion Sort. 
   	The double bars represent the sort marker. 
   	For each list state how many comparisons and swaps are needed to sort the next number.
	1. [1 3 4 8 9 || 5 2]
	2. [1 3 4 5 8 9 || 2]
	3. [1 3 || 4 9 2 8 ]
	4. [1 2 3 8 || 7 6]
	5. [2 3 4 6 7 8 9 || 1]
	Hint: Check the insertion sort algorithm in L07 and L08.


3. 	Consider the following lists of partially sorted numbers using Selection Sort. 
   	The double bars represent the sort marker. For each list state how many comparisons and swaps are needed to sort the next number.
	1. [1 3 4 6 7 || 9 8]
	2. [1 2 4 5 8 || 9]
	3. [1 3 || 4 9 6 8 ]
	4. [|| 9 2 3 8 1 6 4]
	5. [2 3 4 || 9 8 7 6 5]
	Hint: Check the selection sort algorithm in L05 and L06.


4. For sorting algorithms, what three operations make up most 
   of the running time of the algorithm? 


5. Suppose a certain sorting algorithm uses the swap operation to order numbers. 
   Given a list of n numbers, how many memory cells would you expect the 
   algorithm would require?


6. 	For each of the following lists, determine the number of 
	comparisons and swaps the Insertion Sort and the Selection Sort require.  
	Write your answer in a table below.
	(*Note table is arranged different than word doc.)
	
						INSERTION		SELECTION
						Comp	Swap	Comp	Swap
	1. [2 4 6 9 3 1]	
	2. [2 3 6 9 8]
	3. [9 8 7 6 1]
	4. [1 2 6 5 9]

7. What is another way of writing the summation (n-1) + (n-2) + ... + 1? 


8. Using the formula from your previous answer, 
   compute the number of comparisons the Insertion Sort requires 
   in the worst case to sort the following groups of items.
   1. 50
   2. 129
   3. 2,457
   4. 19,843
   5. 109,503

9. Rank the following list of efficiency formulas 
   from most efficient to least efficient: 
   n2, n, 2n, log n, n3, 10n. 
   (Hint: if you are unsure of the order, test each formula with several large values of n.)

10. For the following four efficiency formulas, 
	calculate the number of operations performed for 
	n = 100, n = 1,000, and n = 10,000. 
	Fill the answers in the table below.

						n= 100		n=1,000		n=10,000					
	1. n2
	2. n2 - n + 5
	3. n2 + 4n - 12
	4. n2 - 3n - 7
